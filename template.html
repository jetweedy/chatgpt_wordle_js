<h1>Teaching Chat GPT to write a Wordle in JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Context:</h2>
<p>
What follows is a chat session with Chat GPT in which I try to teach it to write a Wordle game in JavaScript. It makes a number of mistakes, but ultimately is able to successfully generate a functional game resembling the popular one in the NY Times. It only has a few words in its bank, so you'll get the same words again and again if you play it a lot of times. You can see the word in the console if you open up the developer tools (F12).
